If a response is  'flagged', the user can continue talking to the bot. If it is 'not flagged', the user is referred to help. We are going to predict if it is flagged or not according to users responses.


## Steps Included

- Tokenisation
- Preprocessing
- Generating Response
    - Bag of Words After the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. The bag-of-words is a representation of text         that describes the occurrence of words within a document. \
    - TF-IDF Approach
    - Cosine Similarity 
- Finally, we will feed the lines that we want our bot to say while starting and ending a conversation depending upon userâ€™s input.
